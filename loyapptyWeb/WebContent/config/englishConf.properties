Loyaltymsg=- Customer loyalty is about attracting the right customer, getting them to return, buy often, and bring you even more customers.<br /> <br /> - You build customer loyalty by:<br />* Keeping touch with customers using Loyappty, to send thank you notes, coupons, offers, reminders, updates, and much more!<br />* Attracting new customers by communicating timely and compelling offers;<br />* Showing that you care and remembering what customers like and don't like;<br />* Rewarding customers for choosing you over your competitors<br />
Inactive=Inactive
Registermsg=The following information is important so that customers can easily find your business listed in the Loyappty Mobile App:
Clicktochange=Click to change
LocationRelevant=My business location is key to customers (e.g. restaurant)
NoUrl=Please fill the HTML URL Template field
Newalerthelp=Build your message in 3 simple steps and send it to your clients:<br /><br /><strong>Step 1:</strong> Select recipients. Select a loyappty and all customers subscribed to it will receive the message.<br /><strong>Step 2:</strong> Set message. Compose a message or provide a URL.<br /><strong>Step 3:</strong> Send message. You can send the message immediately or schedule it for later delivery.
NewcampName=The name is how customers will identify the loyappty listed on the Loyappty Mobile App. Choose a descriptive, short phrase. Some good examples are: "Discount Coupons", "Special offers and events", "Weekly newsletter", "Up to the minute info", "Announcements".
NewcampDesc=When customers click on the name of the listed loyappty in the mobile app, they will see this detailed description. In the case of a coupon for example, information that customers may find helpful here include:  the discount percentage, how to redeem it, expiration date, any special conditions.
NewcampIcon=Select an icon that describes the nature of the loyappty. There are a number of Internet sites such as <a href="http://openclipart.org/" target="_blank">http://openclipart.org/</a> that offer royalty free icons.<br /><br />Image must be jpg, jpeg, png or gif and should preferably be square no less than 160x160 and the size no more than 400KB. If you find an icon you like in the Internet save it to your computer and then upload it into Loyappty. You can drag and drop the image to the Logo area instead of using the Upload file button.
NewcampAdvc=More than 99% of all loyappties will not require this "Advanced Opt-in" feature. In all likelihood, everything will be fine if leaving this box unchecked. Only if you have successfully created a good number of loyappties without this feature, we recommend you learn more now about it.<br /><br />The "Advanced Opt-in" feature allows you to send customers an Internet link (URL) that when customers open in the Loyappty Mobile App, will redirect them to an Internet page, something like http://www.businessname.com/loyappty, that you must have created and hosted in your own Information Technology (IT) servers.<br /><br />This page may be a form that asks the customer, and customer agrees to provide, personal information such as name, address, email, phone number and other demographic information.<br /><br />This exchange of information happens completely outside Loyappty, therefore Loyappty never sees and can never record any of it. It is absolutely private to the business and its customers.<br /><br />Through this feature, Loyappty allows businesses to identify customers beyond the automatically generated alias that Loyappty assigns to each. If business asks and saves information on their databases, every time Loyappty redirects a customer to a business provided URL, business can provide a completely personalized service to customer based on the information it has stored on its database. You can always send an email to support@loyappty.com for assistance with this feature.
NewcampButton=In Loyappty there is not unwanted communications to customers. Customers receive on the Loyappty Mobile App only loyappties they have requested. They can all also either freeze (going out of town for a while) or stop (not interested any more) any loyappty. <br /><br />This new loyappty when activated, will show up in the Loyalty Mobile App, and customers through a simple click can opt-in and subscribe to it.<br /><br />You can also display a QR Code on a printed sign, website or advertising, that customers can read on their mobile phones. Loyappty automatically generates the QR Code for you!
Registerhelploc=Loyappty supports location based services on the mobile phone. When customers share their location on the mobile phone with Loyappty, they can search for nearby businesses.<br /><br />Examples of business for which physical location is key are restaurants, gas stations, and car washes.
