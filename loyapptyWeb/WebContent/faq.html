      <h3 class="Titulo"><strong> What is Loyappty?</strong></h3>
      <p>Loyappty is a simple way for any business to build customer loyalty by interacting via mobile phone.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>There are two elements to loyapptying:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="/loyapptyWeb/index.jsp" class="Titulo" target="_blank">http://loyappty.com</a>. Businesses after registering, begin interacting with customers by creating and sending <strong><em>loyappties </em></strong><em>. Loyappties</em> can be coupons, offers, reminders, updates, and much more!      </li>
        <li>Loyappty Mobile App. Customers download it on their mobile phone, browse and search for businesses and opt-in to <em>loyappties</em> they want.        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>To customers is a simple way to find and stay in touch with businesses they like.  It is absolutely free. There is no registration and no login. Customers simply download and start searching for businesses by name, category, or location. Loyappty allows searching for registered businesses or the local Yellow Pages listing.  </p>
      <p>Loyappty is location aware, search for nearby pizza, gas, wi-fi spot! Businesses will create loyappties in the form of coupons, offers, reminders, or updates customers can opt-in to. There is no spamming in loyappty, none!  Customers only receive what they opted-in or subscribed to. Changed their mind? No problem. They can freeze (stop temporarily) or permanently stop any, or all, of their loyappties selections at any time.  There is no need to disclose any personal information, not even their mobile phone number.</p>

<strong class="Titulo">Is Loyappty free to Customers?</strong>
      <p>Yes. It is absolutely free to Customers. There is no cost whatsoever to download and use the app, other of course than standard data charges billed by the mobile operator under the data plan.</p>
<strong class="Titulo">How much does it cost to businesses?</strong>
      <p>Please see the <span class="Titulo"><a href="pricing.html" class="Titulo" target="_blank">pricing chart</a></span>.</p>
<strong class="Titulo">Is there advertising in Loyappty?</strong>
      <p>No. Loyappty&rsquo;s only source of income is what it receives from businesses.</p>
<strong class="Titulo">Does the Loyappty Mobile App supports all mobile phones?</strong>
      <p>No. Currently the app runs on iPhones, Android and BlackBerry [*needs more detail*].  Additional versions of the app are being worked on to support more platforms.</p>
<strong class="Titulo">Where can I download the Loyappty Mobile App?</strong>
      <p>Please visit the <a href="download.jsp" class="Titulo" target="_blank">download page</a>.</p>
<strong class="Titulo">Do businesses need the mobile number of their customers to use Loyappty?</strong>
      <p>No. This is a great Loyappty feature, it works without the need to ever disclose any personal information.</p>
<strong class="Titulo">How do businesses identify customers using Loyappty?</strong>
      <p>Each customer is assigned a random alias. But for the most part businesses do not need to worry about this; Loyappty manages the distribution lists automatically. It works like this:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Business creates a loyappty;</li>
        <li>Customers opt-in or subscribe to the loyappty;</li>
        <li>Business sends the loyappty to all subscribed customers;</li>
      </ol>
<strong class="Titulo">How do customers subscribe to a loyappty?</strong>
      <p>Customers can browse and search for something of interest in the Loyappty Mobile App and find the business and its published loyappties listed. A simple click to the loyappty of choice will start the subscription. </p>
      <p>Additionally, when businesses create a new loyappty, an opt-in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code" class="Titulo" target="_blank"><strong>QR Code</strong></a> is automatically generated. Businesses can then print or copy/paste the QR Code on a flyer, poster, website, menu, t-shirt. Customers scan it on their mobile phone using a free QR Code Reader.</p>
<strong class="Titulo">In creating a Loyappty, what is the Advanced Opt-in feature for?</strong>
      <p>More than 99% of all loyappties will not require this &quot;Advanced Opt-in&quot; feature. In all likelihood, everything will be fine if leaving this box unchecked. Only if you have successfully created a good number of loyappties without this feature, we recommend you learn more now about it. </p>
      <p>The&nbsp;&quot;Advanced Opt-in&quot; feature allows you to send&nbsp;customers an Internet link (URL) that when customers open in the Loyappty Mobile App, will redirect&nbsp;them to an Internet page, something like <span class="Titulo">http://www.businessname.com/loyappty</span>, that you must have created and hosted in your own Information Technology (IT) servers.</p>
      <p>This page maybe be a form that asks the customer, and customer agrees to provide, personal information such as name, address, email, phone number and other demographic information. </p>
      <p>This exchange of information happens completely outside Loyappty, therefore Loyappty never sees and can never record any of it. It is absolutely private to the business and its customers.</p>
    <p>Through this feature, Loyappty allows businesses to identify customers beyond the automatically generated alias that Loyappty assigns to each. If business asks and saves information on their databases, every time Loyappty redirects a customer to a business provided URL,&nbsp;business can provide a completely personalized&nbsp;service to customer based on the&nbsp;information it has stored on its database. You can always send an email to <a href="mailto:support@loyappty.com" class="Titulo">support@loyappty.com</a> for assistance with this feature.</p>
