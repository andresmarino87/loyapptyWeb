      <p><strong>Effective February 1, 2012</strong></p>
      <p>Loyappty is a division of Ogangi Corporation (&quot;Ogangi&quot;), a Delaware corporation headquartered in 9155 S Dadeland Blvd, Suite 1505, Miami, FL 33156. </p>
      <p>Ogangi provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of Loyappty, a service for any business to build customer loyalty by interacting via mobile phone. We make the service available to businesses through <a href="/loyapptyWeb/index.jsp" target="_blank">http://loyappty.com</a> (the &quot;Site&quot;) and through applications for mobile devices (the &quot;Application&quot; or &quot;Applications&quot;). This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site or through the Application. You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Loyappty <a href="termsofservice.html" target="_blank"><span class="Titulo">Terms of Service. </span></a></p>
      <p><strong class="Titulo">Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
      <p>As used in this policy, the terms &quot;using&quot; and &quot;processing&quot; information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.<br />
      Our primary goals in collecting information are to enable you to utilize the features of the Application and access the Site, as well as to provide related services, features and content and to administer your account (together, the &quot;<strong><em>Service</em></strong>&quot;).</p>
      <p><strong class="Titulo">Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
      <p>a) In the course of using the Service, we may ask businesses to provide us with, or grant us access to, or permission to obtain, certain identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify the business; personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to, business name and email address (&quot;<strong><em>Personal Information</em></strong>&quot;). </p>
      <p>b) We collect Business Information in connection with your registration to join our Service. You can register to join via the Site (&quot;<strong><em>Personal Information</em></strong>&quot;).</p>
      <p>c) In the Applications there is no registration, and other than the Customer authorizing the use of its location, there is no collection whatsoever of information such as name, email address (&quot;<strong><em>Personal Information</em></strong>&quot;)</p>
      <p>d) As part of the functionality of the Site and Application, you may view and accept offers from third party businesses (&quot;<strong><em>Third Party Services(s)</em></strong>&quot;). There is no advertising within the Site and Application. By accessing Third Party Services within Loyappty, you are granting Ogangi permission to use information related to your use of Third Party Services within Loyappty (e.g. subscription data, your activity on the website, service or application), which can be accessed and used by Ogangi within the Site and Application; Ogangi may use and store this information and such information will be presented to you within the Site and Application in order to provide you with certain functionality of the Site and Application. </p>
      <p>e) By submitting this Third Party Services information to Ogangi and granting Ogangi permission to access and use such information, you represent that you are entitled to submit and grant access to such information to Ogangi for use for the purposes described herein. Ogangi makes no effort to review the information that will be presented to you in the Site and Application from such Third Party Services for any purpose, including but not limited to accuracy, legality or non-infringement. Ogangi cannot always foresee or anticipate technical or other difficulties, which may result in failure to obtain data or loss of information, personalization settings or other service interruptions. Ogangi cannot assume responsibility for the timeliness, accuracy, deletion, non-delivery or failure to store any Third Party Services data, communications or personalization settings.</p>
      <p>f) Loyappty also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your profile on the Site or Application (e.g., without limitation, individual preferences) (&quot;<strong><em>Non-Identifying Information</em></strong>&quot;).</p>
      <p>g) Loyappty also may use your Personal Information to contact you with newsletters, marketing communications on behalf of Ogangi. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from Loyappty, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or contact us at<a href="mailto:help@loyappty.com" class="Titulo"> help@loyappty.com</a>(See &quot;<strong><em>Changing or Deleting Information,</em></strong>&quot; below.)</p>
<p><strong class="Titulo">Log Data</strong><br />
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>When you use the Service, (e.g. when you visit the Site or interact with our Application) whether as a registered User or otherwise, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or service connected to the Internet (&quot;<strong><em>Log Data</em></strong>&quot;). This Log Data may include information such as your computer&rsquo;s Internet Protocol (&quot;<strong><em>IP</em></strong>&quot;) address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site or accessed our Application, areas of our Site or Application that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site or through our Application, products viewed, products subscribed to, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site, Application and the Service and for the Site and Application&rsquo;s technical administration, to increase our Site and Application&rsquo;s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors&rsquo; needs.</li>
        <li>When you launch the Application, we collect your mobile device type, the unique device ID of your mobile device (&quot;<strong><em>Device ID</em></strong>&quot;) and IP address, if applicable. We use the Device ID to make it possible to authenticate and understand use of our Service. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong class="Titulo">Promotion</strong>      </p>
      <p>From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in surveys, contests or sweepstakes (collectively, &quot;<strong><em>Promotions</em></strong>&quot;) through the Site and Application or via email or text messaging. If you participate, we will request certain Personal Information from you. Participation in these Promotions is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. We use this information to administer your participation in each Promotion.</p>
      <strong class="Titulo">Cookies</strong><br />
      
      <p>As is standard practice on many websites, the Site and Application use &quot;<strong><em>cookies</em></strong>&quot; to help us study traffic patterns on our Site and Application and understand the effectiveness of our marketing communications. A cookie is a small string of text that a website can send to your browser. We utilize two types of cookies as part of the Service. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your Loyappty Account information for future logins to the Application, Site and Service and to integrate your usage of the Application, Site and Service with the appropriate SNS. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Application, Site and Service, to better understand how you interact with the Application, Site and Service and to monitor aggregate usage by Users and web traffic routing on the Application, Site and Service. Cookies can reveal, for instance, which pages on the Site and Application are the most popular, how much time visitors are spending there, and how they are interacting with the content on these pages. You have the option to disable cookies by changing the options in your browser to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to view or use all portions of the Site and Application due to limited functionality.</p>
      <p><strong class="Titulo">Web Beacons</strong> </p>
<p>We may also use &quot;web beacons,&quot; &quot;pixel tags,&quot; &quot;clear GIFs&quot; or similar means (individually or collectively &quot;<strong><em>Web Beacons</em></strong>&quot;) in our Application and on the Site. A Web Beacon is an electronic image, often a single pixel, embedded on web pages. Web Beacons are ordinarily not visible to users. Web Beacons allow us to count the number of users who have visited certain pages of the Application or Site, to deliver services and to generate statistics about how our Application and Site are used.</p>
<p><strong class="Titulo">Inviting Friends to use Loyappty</strong></p>
<p>If you choose to use our services to tell a friend about our Service, we will ask you for your friend&rsquo;s email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Service. Ogangi stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time emails and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at<a href="mailto:help@loyappty.com" class="Titulo"><strong> help@loyappty.com </strong></a>to request that we remove this information from our database. </p>
<p><strong class="Titulo">Phishing</strong></p>
<p>Identity theft and the practice currently known as &quot;phishing&quot; are of great concern to Ogangi. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your Loyappty Account information login information or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the <a href="http://ftc.gov/" class="Titulo" target="_blank">Federal Trade Commission&rsquo;s website</a></p>
<strong class="Titulo">Information Sharing Disclosure</strong>
      <p><strong>Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information</strong>. We may share aggregated information that includes your Personal Information, Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis and demographic profiling.</p>
      <p><strong>Third Party Services</strong>&nbsp;When you subscribe to a Third Party Business using the Service, we will share with that service the information required to process your subscription.</p>
      <p><strong>Service Providers</strong>. We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Site or Application-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Site or Application&rsquo;s features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Site, Application and Service are used. These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. In addition, we utilize a third party web analytics service provider, but only for the Site.</p>
      <p><strong>Third Party Social Networking Services</strong>. As a User, you may link your Loyappty Account with certain SNSs where you have an existing account with the SNSs. In these instances, with your permission and on your behalf, we will share your Loyappty Account information with the applicable SNS. Through use of such SNSs&rsquo; APIs, as stated above, we also receive certain information (which may include your Personal Information) in accordance with the privacy settings you have set in your SNS account, if any. Other than what we may share with the SNS in connection with your linking of accounts, the Personal Information an SNS has about you is obtained by the SNS independent of our Service. Other services, including the SNSs, follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the Personal Information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other services you use.</p>
      <p><strong>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</strong>. Ogangi cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Ogangi or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Transfers</strong>. Ogangi may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.</p>

If you completely delete all such information, then your account may become deactivated. In the event you would like us to delete your record in our system, please contact us at <a href="mailto:help@loyappty.com" class="Titulo"><strong>help@loyappty.com</strong></a> with a detailed request to delete your Personal Information from our database. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.</p>
      <p><strong class="Titulo">Disclosures</strong></p>
      <p>We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored &quot;business and personal data&quot; (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.</p>

      <p>Personal Information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Ogangi transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
